An OTLP exporter (e.g., data source) sends metrics to the ingestion API.
DNS-based routing and load balancing distribute requests across OTLP collector ingestion nodes.
OTLP collector ingestion nodes export metrics to distributed message queue (e.g., Kafka).
OTLP collector processing nodes consume metrics from distributed message queue.
OTLP collector processing nodes sends metrics to the storage API.
DNS-based routing and load balancing distribute requests across hot storage nodes (e.g., influxDB, VictoriaMetrics).
Hot storage nodes expire metrics to cold storage (e.g., MinIO).
