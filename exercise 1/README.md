- **Systems design question**  
  - How would you implement a time-series metrics system that needs to store a  
    large amount of data from a large number of sources with a limited storage  
    capacity that needs to access historical data?  

    Include a description of the pathway through the system for:  
    1. A metric being written  
    2. A query being executed
