A query is submitted to the query API (directly or via a UI).
DNS-based routing and load balancing distribute requests across query-federation nodes (e.g. Thanos/VictoriaMetrics, InfluxDB-IOx/InfluxDB).
Query federation nodes split queries into parallel sub-queries targeting multi-tiered sources.
Query federation nodes typically access and update a cache (e.g., Redis) for recently accessed data
Query federation nodes merge results from multiple sources.
Query results are returned to the requestor.
