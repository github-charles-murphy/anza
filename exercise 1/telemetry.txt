1. Ingestion Layer

Ingests telemetry via a high-throughput, distributed API (e.g., Otel Collector - OLTP via HTTP/gRPC).
Uses a distributed message queue for decoupling, buffering, durability and availability of high-velocity telemetry (e.g., Kafka).

2. Processing Layer:

Consumes telemetry from the ingestion layer asynchronously (e.g. Otel KafkaReceiver).
Optionally, perform downsampling, aggregation and/or transformation of telemetry (e.g., using statistical and windowing techniques).
Sends transformed data to storage layer (e.g. Otel KafkaExporter).

3. Storage Layer:

Hot Storage: High-performance time-series database (TSDB) for recent data (e.g. InfluxDB, Victoria[Metrics/Logs], Jaeger). 
Optionally, perform downsampling, aggregation and/or transformation of telemetry (e.g., using statistical and windowing techniques).
Apply TTL/retention policies to retire data to cold storage.
Cold Storage: Object storage for historical/archival data with aggressive compression (e.g. MinIO).

4. Indexing & Query Layer:

A multi-tiered query-federation engine (e.g. InfluxDB-IOx, Thanos) routes requests to appropriate storage based on the time range.
For each storage, data indexing/partitioning based on time and/or source is configured for efficient querying.
